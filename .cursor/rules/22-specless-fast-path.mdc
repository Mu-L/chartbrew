description: Implement tiny changes without a full spec

If the user says "quick change", "tiny fix", specifically mentions to avoid creating specs, or provides a one-paragraph description:
1) Generate a 3-bullet Patch Plan.
2) Implement directly with tests.
3) Add a 1-line changelog entry and skip spec/ADR.

If unclear, ask the user if they want to create a spec.
