description: Implement changes directly from the latest Feature Spec with minimal diffs
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
Workflow:
1) Locate the most recent FS in docs/specs with status draft|accepted.
2) Produce a short "Patch Plan" listing exact files and functions to change.
3) Apply edits in place. Avoid new files unless the FS explicitly requires it.
4) Update or add tests next to touched code.
5) Update the FS status or links if needed when merged.

Constraints:
- JavaScript only, double quotes, no TypeScript.
- Keep diffs surgical, prefer modifying existing code over adding new modules.
- No scaffolding, no placeholders unless a blocker is explicitly identified.
