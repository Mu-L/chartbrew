## Problem
<one tight paragraph>

## Goals
- <goal 1>
- <goal 2>

## Non-goals
- <not doing>

## UX & API
- UI states and edge cases in bullets
- For API, routes with method, params, responses

## Data & Permissions
- New tables/fields, ACL, rate limits

## Risks
- Unknowns + cheap spike

## Definition of Done
- Tests (backend only in '/server/tests'), docs, migration run
