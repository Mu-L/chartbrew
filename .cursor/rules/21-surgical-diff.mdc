- Prefer editing the smallest number of files.
- If a change spans multiple layers, adjust integration points first, then propagate.
- Keep import graphs stable. Reuse existing helpers instead of adding new ones.
- When adding a dependency, justify it in the Patch Plan and consider an internal helper first.
